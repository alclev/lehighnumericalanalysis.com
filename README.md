# A Programming Platform for Numerical Analysis - Frontend

The goal of this project is to learn Numerical analysis through programming. We developed a library of matrix operations and solvers in C++ with no dependencies. We aimed for accessibility and high performance by making a front-end website to demonstrate the operations as well as developing parallel versions of the algorithms.

## Getting started

To run the frontend locally make sure to have ``npm`` installed

1. cd src/
2. npm start

This will start the front end locally

A full list of expected functionality will be given at the start of the project, and you are encouraged to contribute to this list (with Professor Carr\\u2019s approval). Your software should allow for different data storage types (e.g., arrays and lists) and formats (e.g., compressed sparse row and jagged diagonal). Such functionality is integral to Professor Carr\\u2019s research, and she is interested in software that can grow beyond this capstone project. So, it should be built in such a way that plugins can be added later on. Parallel algorithms can also be developed (e.g., sparse matrix-vector products and the Jacobi iteration), but only after successful and efficient development of the sequential algorithms. You are encouraged to build a theoretical analysis of the complexity of the implemented algorithms. Your software should not be proprietary (e.g., while you may develop some concepts initially in MATLAB, your final project should not depend on it). Professor Carr is also interested in publishing scholarly articles on this work with opportunities for group members to serve as co-authors alongside her.
